        <section id="welcome">
            <p>Dear friends, get ready for a rejuvenating and memorable 4-day escape designed just for us! We've planned a fantastic trip between <span class="highlight">November 22nd and 30th</span> (you choose your preferred 4-day window within this period) that promises relaxation, fun, and quality time together. From delicious food to breathtaking sights, every detail has been thoughtfully considered to ensure we maximize our moments and create lasting memories. Let the good times roll!</p>
        </section>

        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Trip Overview & Philosophy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Choose any 4 consecutive days between <span class="highlight">November 22nd and November 30th</span>.</li>
                <li><strong>Group Size:</strong> Our beloved group of 60-year-olds!</li>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To relax, connect, experience new sights, and most importantly, maximize our shared time and enjoyment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Maximizing Time Together - Our Constraints:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shared Accommodation:</strong> We will all stay in one central, comfortable location (e.g., a large villa, interconnected hotel suites, or a boutique resort) to ensure easy communication and spontaneity.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-booked Transport:</strong> All local transport will be pre-arranged (e.g., a comfortable mini-bus or multiple spacious taxis/vans) to avoid waiting times and ensure we travel together.</li>
                <li><strong>Group Dining:</strong> All meals will be planned at common venues. While individual preferences will be considered, the focus will be on shared culinary experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Itinerary:</strong> While activities are suggested, there will be ample free time for spontaneous conversations, card games, or simply relaxing together. Participation in activities is encouraged but optional; the priority is group cohesion.</li>
                <li><strong>Easy Accessibility:</strong> All chosen venues and activities will prioritize easy accessibility, minimizing long walks or strenuous physical demands.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="destination-transit">
            <h2>Destination Choice & Transit from Bangalore</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proposed Destination:</strong> <span class="highlight">Mysore, Karnataka</span> (A perfect blend of culture, history, and accessibility from Bangalore, offering a relaxed pace suitable for our group.)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Transit from Bangalore:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mode of Transport:</strong> Comfortable, air-conditioned mini-bus (e.g., a Tempo Traveller or similar) or multiple large SUVs/sedans, depending on final group size. This ensures we travel together, share stories, and arrive fresh.</li>
                <li><strong>Travel Time:</strong> Approximately 3-4 hours (depending on traffic).</li>
                <li><strong>Departure Point in Bangalore:</strong> A central, easily accessible pick-up point will be arranged (e.g., a common landmark or multiple pick-ups if feasible).</li>
                <li><strong>Onboard Comfort:</strong> The vehicle will be equipped with comfortable seating, ample legroom, and provisions for water and light snacks. Scheduled comfort breaks will be taken.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="accommodation">
            <h2>Accommodation (Example: Boutique Hotel / Heritage Stay)</h2>
            <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> A centrally located boutique hotel or heritage property that offers spacious rooms, good amenities, and a relaxed ambiance. Look for options with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground floor rooms or easy elevator access.</li>
                <li>On-site restaurant and lounge area for group gatherings.</li>
                <li>Gardens or common areas for relaxation.</li>
                <li>Examples (research specific properties for November): The Green Hotel, Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel Mysore (for modern comfort), Hotel Mysore Dasprakash (for a blend of comfort and history).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Benefit for Group:</strong> Provides a comfortable base, easy access to common areas for unwinding, and eliminates separate travel to individual rooms after activities.</p>
